# Workday Scheduler by Captain Flint

## Description

This project is designed to allow a workday planner webpage to be able to display the current date, save user inputs for hourly events/tasks, and color coordinate the hourly tabs to clearly indicate the passage of time throughout the day. In the process of making this work I gained familiarity with dayjs and practiced the use of local storage and jQuery.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Enter text into the blank area between the hour and the save button. Click the blue save button on the right to save events/tasks.
